** CATEgorize TRANsactions. (I just liked the way it sounds.) **

The idea is to automatically categorize transactions downloaded from a bank website in CSV format, similar to how mint does. Hopefully this will allow more powerful queries in my own budget spreadsheet. Not sure how great my approach is yet, LMK.
